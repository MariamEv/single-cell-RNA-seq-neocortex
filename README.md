# single-cell-RNA-seq-neocortex
Neocortex is a region in the brain which governs higher-level functions such as perception and cognition. 


single-cell RNA-seq dataset, with the goal of unveiling hierarchical structure and discovering important genes. The datasets provided are all different subsets of a larger single-cell RNA-seq dataset, compiled by the Allen Institute. This data contains cells from the mouse neocortex, a region in the brain which governs higher-level functions such as perception and cognition.
